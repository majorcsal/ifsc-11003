           <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
           <p>THe reason why I think is important in modern in modern web development is because it helps give people content in a way that keeps them an easily presentible from and it keeps them interested. As when I go onto a site I want the content to be easily findable and readable and so progressive enhancment is incredibly important for that.

           <h2>Mars Project revision and refelctions</h2>
           <p>Some revisions that my family suggested was adding more details to my home page as it is pretty barebones.</p>
           <p>some reflections from my tie in this class is that it shown a new light on web design and programming. It is a lot easier that I expected to be and much harder as well mostly because there are so many different ways to program something and it felt a little overwhelming but was still kinda fun I actually enjoyed working in the class. also working on the mars rover project was interesting granted I don't think I did the best on it as I don't view myself as a super creative person it was intersting building a website from scratch and using the skills that I had learned in the class. </p>
