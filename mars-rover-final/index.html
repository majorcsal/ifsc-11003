  <h2>Why are we exploring mars</h2>
  <p>Humanity explores Mars to search for signs of life either currently or from thousands of years ago, to understand its history, and to prepare for a time when humans might visit it. Scientists are drawn to Mars because it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, with evidence that it once had liquid water, a thicker atmosphere, and a potentially habitable enviorment. Studying Mars helps us learn how planets have evolved, it deepens our understanding of Earth’s own climate and geology, and helps us find out if life did live on mars is it possible to make it happen again. As we explore Mars we also lays the groundwork potential human settlement, testing new technologies and strategies that could one day make interplanetary living possible</p>
