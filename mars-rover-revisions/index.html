  <h2>Why are we exploring mars</h2>
  <p>Humanity explores Mars to search for signs of life either currently or from thousands of years ago, to understand its history, and to prepare for a time when humans might visit it. Scientists are drawn to Mars because it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, with evidence that it once had liquid water, a thicker atmosphere, and a potentially habitable enviorment. Studying Mars helps us learn how planets have evolved, it deepens our understanding of Earth’s own climate and geology, and helps us find out if life did live on mars is it possible to make it happen again. As we explore Mars we also lays the groundwork potential human settlement, testing new technologies and strategies that could one day make interplanetary living possible</p>

    <h3>spirit Rover</h3>
    <p>the rover Sprirt was launched on june 10, 2003, and landed on janurary 4, 2004. its mission was originally only meant to last for 90 days. it instead continued is mission of exploring mars for the next 6 years and traveled over 4.8 miles across the surface if mars. Some the the achievements of this rover is that it uncovered evidence of water on the planet, it was the frist rover to go over a hill on mars and even after ones if its wheel stopped working it continued moving on</p>

    <h3>Curiosity Rover</h3>
  <p>the rover Curiosoty was launched on november 26, 2011, and landed on Mars on august 6, 2012. its mission was originally planned to only last 2 years but it is still active to this day. Curiosity's mission was to discover if life on mars had ever happened in any form and it succeded in this mission finding evidence of possible microbial life. it also explored the mars mountain mount hsarp to discover how mars had evolced over the years by analyzing the sediment in the mountain </p>
