        <h3>Spirit Timeline</h2>
      </article>
<p> Spirit was part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover program. The mission was explore Mars surface and search for evidence of any past water activity to understand the planet’s habitability. Spirit was launched on June 10, 2003, from Cape Canaveral aboard a Delta II rocket, and landed on Mars on January 4, 2004, in the Gusev Crater region, which is believed to have once been a lake.</p>
<p>here is a timeline of it stay on mars</p>
<div class="timeline">

        <h4>2004 - Early Days</h4>
        <p><strong>2004:</strong> After landing Spirit began investigating the nearby rock and soil for signs of past water activity, in which it did find some evidence of along with the possibily of an ancient volcano.</p>

        <h4>2005 - 2006 - Extended stay</h4>
        <p><strong>2005 - 2006:</strong> The ground on mars was both incredibly diffucult to navigate and so Spirit often found itself stuck for extended periods of time, but despite that it still contiued to conduct research on mars surface.</p>

        <h4>2007 - Continued Exploration</h4>
        <p><strong>2007:</strong> Spirit discovering evidence of past hydrothermal activity which possible could have supported microbial life.</p>
        <p><strong>2008:</strong> Spirit's right front wheel stopped working, which forced the rover to start drive backwards, which caused the wheel to drag. This however exposed bright white silica deposits, which rpovied more evidence that mars past water activity.</p>

        <h4>2009 - Final Year</h4>
        <p><strong>May 2009:</strong> Spirit evetually gathered to much dust on it solar panels causing it to lose energy and eventually became stuck in soft soil. Despite extensive efforts made by mission engineers, the rover could not get free. However, Spirit continued performing its duty. 
          
          <h4>2010 - Mission Ends</h4>
        <p><strong>March 22, 2010:</strong> After an extreme winter martian storm NASA lost contact with spirit.</p>
        <p><strong>May 25, 2011:</strong> NASA offically declared spirits mission over after its long years of sending back valuable data.</p>

        <h3>Curiosity Timeline</h2>
      </article>
      <p>The rover Curiosity's mission was to explore mars sruface and find any evidence microbial life which would help us understand the habitability of the planet. aunched on November 26, 2011, from Cape Canaveral aboard an Atlas V rocket. Its landing on Mars occurred on August 6, 2012, in the Gale Crater</p>
      <div class="timeline">

        <h4>2004 - Early Discoveries</h4>
        <p><strong>2013:</strong>Discovered an ancient streambed, which provided evidence of flowing water in the Gale Crater.</p>

        <h4>2014</h4>
        <p><strong>2014:</strong>Detected the elements sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon in rocks, confirming the presence of key ingredients for life to form.</p>

        <h4>2015</h4>
        <p><strong>2015:</strong> The rover identifed methane fluctuations in the atmosphere,  which sparked an ongoing analysis of its source.</p>

        <h4>2017</h4>
        <p><strong>2017:</strong> The rover found evidence of ancient freshwater environments and climate variability from rock layer analysis in Mount Sharp.</p>
          
          <h4>2019 to today</h4>
        <p><strong>2019:</strong> The rover continued today to analysis the sedimentary rock layers of the planet and continues Studying of the habitability and radiation conditions of the planet.</p>
